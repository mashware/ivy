/// The most that is read from a file.
///
/// It is not prudence: it bounds **what a file from outside can make get reserved when it is
/// interpreted**, and that is why it is applied **inside** the read —see [`read`]—, because checking
/// it afterwards would already have reserved.
///
/// **The multiplier depends on the shape of the file, not on its size**, and that is why there are
/// three numbers and not one. With exactly 256 KiB, measured in `--release` with
/// `cargo run --release --example read -p panel-contract`:
///
/// | Shape | Peak | Factor | Interpret |
/// |---|---|---|---|
/// | Lines of a real panel | 1.8 MiB | 7× | 2.5 ms |
/// | A single giant line | 769 KiB | 3× | 0.1 ms |
/// | Objects with one key, 32,766 of them — the worst case | **24.5 MiB** | **98×** | **22 ms** |
///
/// **Re-measured on 18 September 2026, when a line gained its optional key**, because a field added
/// to the shape of a line is exactly the thing that could move this table. **It does not move the
/// worst case, and the reason is worth keeping**: the peak follows the number of *values*, so the
/// worst shape is the one packing the most objects into the ceiling — which means the *fewest* keys
/// per object. A key on every line makes each object bigger and therefore fewer of them fit, which
/// walks away from this row rather than towards it — the example's own run of that shape, with two
/// keys per object instead of one, comes out at 68×. What the field costs is what it keeps once the
/// panel is in hand, not what interpreting it reserves.
///
/// **What the ceiling does NOT bound is the time.** The normal case does not come close: a realistic
/// panel is read in around **10 µs**, so re-reading the four of four splits would be a quarter of
/// 1 % of a frame. The one that bites is the pathological one —22 ms, a frame and a half—, and it is
/// enough that it is possible: whoever reads this from a painting loop **cannot re-read on every
/// frame**, it has to re-read only when the file has really changed.
