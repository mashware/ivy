//! Changing one line of a document without republishing the rest.
//!
//! **The vocabulary is the document's and not the transport's**, which is why it lives in this crate
//! beside [`Panel`] and not in `panel-control`. The day a second transport arrives it speaks these
//! same ops through this same reader, and *both transports accept the same document* stays literally
//! true rather than nominally (**D17**).
//!
//! **It sits in its own module rather than in `panel.rs`** for the reason the size rule gives
//! (**D28**): what a document *is* and how it is read is one subject, and how one is edited in place
//! is another. Nothing about the placement changes what the design declared — the ops are this
//! crate's, reached through its own re-exports.
//!
//! **Everything decidable without the document is decided in [`parse_ops`]**, on the connection's
//! own thread and outside the frame: an unknown op name, a `set` naming a field that is not
//! patchable, an `attention` value that is not one of the three, a `line` that is neither a string
//! nor an object, more ops than the ceiling allows. **What is left for [`Panel::patched_with`] is
//! the one question that needs the document** — does this key name a line here.
//!
//! **What that costs in the frame is more than that question, and saying otherwise was the first
//! version of this paragraph.** Applying a patch clones the panel, builds the key index over it, and
//! — at the caller, because the ceiling is the caller's — writes the result out to weigh it. All
//! three scale with the whole document and not with the patch, so a one-op patch on a panel at the
//! ceiling costs about what publishing that panel costs. That is the price of the verb, not a
//! defect: what it saves is the *bytes on the wire* and the producer's own tokens, which is what it
//! was asked for.
//!
//! **D47.**
