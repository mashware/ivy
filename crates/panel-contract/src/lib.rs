#![deny(rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links)]
// **A broken rustdoc link is invisible to the compiler, and half the repository is rustdoc.** When
// this was put in, the tree already had one pointing at a constant that an earlier rename had left
// behind: nobody noticed because `cargo doc` warns and does not fail. With the `deny` it fails, and
// the milestone that renames 46,458 lines is going to be grateful for it.
//
// It fires on `cargo doc`, **not** on `cargo test` — this repository has no continuous integration,
// so it still has to be invoked. What changes is that now it breaks instead of warning.
//! Types for `panel.json`, reading and validation, and **the directory where that file lives**.
//!
//! It depends on nothing visual: if the painting layer is rewritten, this crate keeps serving.
//!
//! The directory is here and not in whoever launches the consoles for the reason the line above
//! gives: **nothing about generating a name, creating a directory and deleting it has anything to do
//! with painting**, so putting it in the crate that is going to be rewritten the day the interface
//! framework changes would force it to be rewritten along with it for no reason at all. And *where*
//! the state is published is part of the contract, just as much as *what* is published.
